This is an angular based frontend to a fullstack project that I call LinuxLife. This is for all the linux lovers who enjoy everything about linux, be it the freedom to do anything ans everything with only a few keyboard commands or the ability to customize each and every element to your liking.

The backend of this project is here: https://github.com/abhinav-mmmut/LinuxLife-backend

The frontend boasts of a modular environment with JWT for authentication and authorization. There is form login to allow the users to register, login and interact with the app. There are a few public pages while others are secure and will only be accesible upon authentication. The styling has been done using bootstrap and I have tried to keep it minimalist as that is how I like things to be!
